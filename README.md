## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Get a binance api key and secret. [Get your own](https://www.binance.com/en/binance-api)

## Usage

Just reference this to your project and you will be able to use the Binance API.

Add the following to your appsettings.config:

```
"Binance": {
    "Key": "binance-api-key",
    "Secret": "binance-api-secret",
    "RecvWindow": 10000
  }
```

And then with the following code:

```
builder.Services.AddBinance();
```

You are go to go, for example Spot:

```
private readonly Spot _spot;

public SpotController(Spot spot)
{
    _spot = spot;
}

[HttpGet("account")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Account()
{
    var result = await _spot.GetAccount();
    return Ok(result);
}
```
