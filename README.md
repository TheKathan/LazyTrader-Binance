## About The Project

This is my solution to integrate Binance API using .NET Core 6.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Get a binance api key and secret. [Get your own](https://www.binance.com/en/binance-api)

## Usage

Just reference this to your project and you will be able to use the Binance API.

Add the following to your appsettings.config:

```
"Binance": {
    "Key": "binance-api-key",
    "Secret": "binance-api-secret",
    "RecvWindow": 10000
  },
"LazyTrader" : {
    "ThrottleSleepTime": 10000,
    "TradableAssets" : "BTC;ETH;TRX"
  }
```

And then with the following code:

```
builder.Services.AddBinance();
```

You are go to go, for example Spot:

```
private readonly Spot _spot;

public SpotController(Spot spot)
{
    _spot = spot;
}

[AllowAnonymous, HttpGet("account")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Account()
{
    var result = await _spot.GetAccount();
    return Ok(result);
}
```

of for Market:

```
private readonly Market _market;

public MarketController(Market market)
{
    _market = market;
}

[AllowAnonymous, HttpGet("exchangeInfo")]
public async Task<IActionResult> ExchangeInfo(string? symbol, List<string>? symbolsList)
{
    var result = await _market.GetExchangeInfo(symbol, symbolsList);
    return Ok(result);
}
```
